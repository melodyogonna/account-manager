# AccountManager


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve account-manager`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Testing
`npx nx test` still has to be done.

### e2e Test
First change directory to the e2e project - `cd e2e`, then execute the e2e tests with `npx nx e2e`

## Documentation
There is a swagger documentation at ```src/openapi3_1.yaml```, I unfornately didn't have the time to set up a UI.

The methods and interfaces are documented with JSDocs.



## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.
